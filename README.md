***JUST ANOTHER PLUA ADDON FOR WORLD OF WARCRAFT***

This addon in combination with enabled protected LUA will help you get the most
out of your WoW experience. This addon is based on JPS with a lot of refactoring
to clean up the codebase which has grown a lot in the last 4 years.

The main goal is to have a clean and fast codebase to allow further development.


***Huge thanks to jp-ganis, htordeux, nishikazuhiro, hax mcgee, pcmd
and many more for all their contributions to the original JPS!***
